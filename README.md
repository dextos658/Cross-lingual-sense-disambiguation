# About the project

In human language, the same word can have different meanings depending on its intended use in a sentence. In the context of natural language processing, word sense discrimination can be described as the ability to determine the meaning of a word used in a given sentence or context.

For example, consider the two examples of the distinct sense that exist for the word **_“bass”_**:

-   I can hear bass /*frequency sound*.
-   He likes to eat grilled bass /*fish*.

Our goal is to prepare a solution that will be able to determine if the word X is used in the same context or not in 2 different sentences. This can be achieved by using different methods: Supervised Machine Learning, Semi-Supervised Learning, Dictionary Methods …

## ✅ Submission 1

We started by defining our group and choosing our area of work. We then checked the scope of work, looked for articles containing similar work and came up with an initial idea for the project.
